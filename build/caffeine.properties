# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties
# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the las
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  = antgrimmitt.css, style.css, 960.css, reset.css

# merge all into one css files

file.stylesheets.mergeall = false

#merged css filename
file.stylesheets.mergeall.filename = styles.css

#caffeine home folder
caffeine.home.directory = C:\\Users\\ant\\PhpstormProjects\\ant new\\

#monitor all files in the css folder
monitorcssfolder =  false

# directory for created css
cssoutput = publish/css/

# directory where the css iso found
cssinput =  css/
